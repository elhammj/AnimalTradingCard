			<p>In the wild, pandas are only found in the remote, mountainous regions of central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, according to the National Zoo. In this area, there are cool, wet bamboo forests that are perfect for the giant panda's needs. Pandas make their dens from hollowed-out logs or stumps of conifer trees found within the forest. </p>
